# Drowsiness-Detection


Simple OpenCV script in Python to detect whether a person's eyes are open or closed. And if the eyes are closed for a certain period of time, the program will detect it and print a message saying so. 

Can be used in online lectures to keep track of a student, or in self driving cars or devices/machines of the sort, where the user is required to pay attention to whatever activity the user is performing.
